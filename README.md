# Cypress - Online Editor

ðŸš€ **Introducing Cypress - Your Innovative Online Editor** ðŸš€

I'm excited to share my latest project: **Cypress**, an innovative online editor designed to enhance your productivity and collaboration experience. In a world dominated by the MERN stack, it's crucial to explore and master diverse technologies. Cypress is built with **Next.js**, **Supabase PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, and **ShadCN-UI**, setting it apart from typical MERN applications.
